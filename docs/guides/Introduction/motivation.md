# Introduction >> Motivation ||10

We have chosen to create resource bookings as one of the first modules we make because of the wide ranging possibilities of coordination that it affords.

Access to resources within a community is a fundemental required capacity for working with commons as well as markets. 

Some of the usecases for this module in a group include:
* Booking rooms at a venue or accomodation
* Booking consulting time
* Booking tools or vehicles
* Booking worktasks in an enterprise


## Contexts for booking things

### Sharing
Any group that wouldl like to simply share any of the things that they have would be able to implement a happ with this module to be able to do so. This is especially simple for anything that does not come with incurring costs. **Couch surfing** is an instance of this where having a visitor does not really cost anything.

Combining this module with a mutual credit module to track time would basically create a functioning [time bank](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_Bank) within a group. 

### Provisioning
A group may want to ensure availibility of some resource that comes with costs. These costs could be in terms of time, money, spare parts, etc. 

Examples of this is a carsharing application where the use of a car is connected degradation of the car and the need for serivice. A group can make agreements on what the costs are and the amount of costs that a person needs to contribute with can be in relation to the amount of time they have used a resource. Based on listing the bookings from the application.

Another case in this category would be to rent a space together and then devide the time that is availble for doing things in this space between the people that are renting it. Room rent could be split between members of the group also based on use.

### Commercial
There are lots of commercial applications for this module. Hotel bookings, conference space bookings, consulting calendar bookings, car rental agencies, restaurant table bookings, etc. Custom logic need to be created to assign costs to each booking and facilitate transactions, invoicing etc.
